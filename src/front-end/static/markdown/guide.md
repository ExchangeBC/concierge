The Procurement Concierge Program (the “Program”) is a key component of the Province of [British Columbia’s Procurement Strategy](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/government/services-for-government-and-broader-public-sector/buy-goods-services-and-construction/support-services/bc_procurement_strategy_2018.pdf).  It empowers the Province’s Procurement Transformation Branch to make meaningful connections between public-sector buyers with unique business problems and vendors with innovative solutions by facilitating market sounding to gather information that could assist the Province and public-sector buyers in the procurement planning process. It achieves this by facilitating better communication between both groups through Requests for Information (“RFI”) and Discovery Day Sessions.

The Program’s web application, the Concierge Web App, is intended to make it easier for public-sector buyers and vendors to take full advantage of what the Program has to offer.

## 1. Public-Sector Buyers

As a public-sector buyer, you can use the Concierge Web App to engage with vendors as part of the pre-planning of a procurement process. By using the Concierge Web App, and with the support of the Program, you will be able to create an account, post a RFI for your business problem, and offer Discovery Day Sessions to vendors.  You will also be able to see vendor profiles, but vendors aren’t able to see the public-sector buyer profiles.

### (i) How to Create an Account

As a public-sector buyer, you can either create your own account or request that the Program create one on your behalf.

If you wish for your account to be set up on your behalf, please contact the Program at [Procurement.Concierge@gov.bc.ca](mailto:Procurement.Concierge@gov.bc.ca). Otherwise, please follow the steps below to create your own account.

#### Step One: Registration Page

Click on the “Sign Up” button at the top-right corner of the screen to be directed to the Concierge Web App account registration page.

#### Step Two: Account Information

Select the “Public Sector Buyer” radio button (if not already selected). 

Next, provide the email address your organization uses as its business contact (either your own work email or one for a generic inbox) and a unique password. Your password must be at least 8 characters long and contain one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter and one number.  Enter your password again to confirm it.

#### Step Three: Public-Sector Buyer Information

Fill out all required fields (indicated by a bold label and an asterisk “*”).

- “Public Sector Entity” is the area of federal, provincial or municipal government, or any other type of public entity, for which you work. For example, if you are part of a ministry, this would be your ministry’s name.
- You may optionally provide branch name, too.

#### Step Four: Contact Information (Optional)

All of the fields in this section are optional, and are recommended if you would like to provide additional contact information to the Program. Vendors and other public-sector buyers will not be able to view this information. 

#### Step Five: Industry Sector(s)

Select the “Industry Sectors” that relate to your work by clicking the “Add” button and selecting from the provided dropdown list. At least one “Industry Sector” must be selected to create your account.

Providing an “Industry Sector” enables the Program to connect you with vendors that are active in the same “Industry Sector”.

#### Step Six: Area(s) of Interest

Add an “Area of Interest” to identify a good or service that you may need to solve your business problem or issue. Select your “Area(s) of Interest” by clicking the “Add” button and selecting from the provided dropdown list. At “least one Area” of Interest must be selected to create your account, but many can be selected if a broad range of goods or services apply.

The available “Areas of Interest” are based on the “Commodity Codes” used by BC Bid ([www.bcbid.gov.bc.ca](www.bcbid.gov.bc.ca)). “Commodity Codes” are a standard classification of goods and services used by the Province.

Selecting an “Area of Interest” enables the Program to connect you with vendors that offer goods or services that are classified under the same “Commodity Code”.

#### Step Seven: Create Account (Registered User Profile)

Once all required fields on the form have been completed, click the “Create Account” button to create your account within the Concierge Web App.

#### Step Eight: Agree to Terms & Conditions

During the registration process, you will be presented with the Terms and Conditions of the Concierge Web App. To agree to the Terms and Conditions, scroll to the end of the Terms and Conditions and click the “I Agree” button on the bottom-right corner of the screen.

If you wish to agree to the Terms and Conditions at a later time, you may do so by clicking the “Skip” link.

Once you have agreed to accept the Terms and Conditions, your registration will be complete and you will receive full access to the benefits and features of the Concierge Web App, including the ability to issue RFIs and participate in Discovery Day Sessions.

### (ii) Requests for Information (RFIs) 

You may use an RFI to conduct market sounding research to better understand what is available in the marketplace. RFIs do not create a competitive process, or involve ranking or scoring of any responses received.

#### How to View RFIs

A complete listing of RFIs posted through the Concierge Web App can be viewed [here](/requests-for-information) (or by clicking the “RFIs” link at the top of the page).  The details of an RFI can be viewed by clicking on its “Project Title”.

#### Want to Post an RFI?

RFIs are used as a market sounding tool to gather information from the real experts – the vendors – about what is available in the marketplace.  Vendors with accounts on the Concierge Web App will be able to view and respond to your RFIs.

If you are interested in posting an RFI, please email your request to [Procurement.Concierge@gov.bc.ca](mailto:Procurement.Concierge@gov.bc.ca). The Program will work with you to develop and manage your RFI.

### (iii) Discovery Day Sessions

#### Want to Participate in a Discovery Day Session?

You may include a Discovery Day Session as part of your RFI. A Discovery Day Session is a meeting specific to one or more RFIs that vendors can attend to discuss your needs and ask questions. Discovery Day Sessions are an opportunity for you to meet with vendors who may have solutions to your business problems and to provide more information about your needs, requirements and constraints.  The intent is to improve the vendors’ understanding of what you need, which will assist them in responding to the RFI in a manner that best elicits the market information you are seeking in order to assist you with your procurement planning objectives.

If you are interested in participating in a Discovery Day Session, please email your request to [Procurement.Concierge@gov.bc.ca](mailto:Procurement.Concierge@gov.bc.ca).  The Program will assist you with developing and managing your RFI and your participation in a Discovery Day Session.
