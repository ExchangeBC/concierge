The Procurement Concierge Program (the “Program”) is a key component of the Province of [British Columbia’s Procurement Strategy](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/bc-bid-resources/support-services/procurement-transformation). It empowers the Province to make meaningful connections between public-sector buyers with unique business problems and vendors with innovative solutions. This is achieved by facilitating better communication between both groups through Requests for Information (“RFIs”) and Discovery Day Sessions, as well as by allowing vendors to introduce their innovative solutions through Unsolicited Proposals ("UPs").

The Program’s web application, the Concierge Web App, is intended to make it easier for public-sector buyers and vendors to take full advantage of what the Program has to offer.

## **1. Public-Sector Buyers**

As a public-sector buyer, you can use the Concierge Web App to engage with vendors. By using the Concierge Web App, and with the support of the Program, you will be able to create an account, post an RFI for your business problem, and offer a Discovery Day Session to vendors. If you are a ministry buyer, you will also be able to view eligible Unsolicited Proposals from vendors.

### **(i) How to Create an Account**

#### **Step One: Registration Page**

Click on the “Sign Up” button at the top-right corner of the screen to be directed to the Concierge Web App account registration page.

#### **Step Two: Account Information**

Select the “Public Sector Buyer” radio button (if not already selected).
Next, provide the email address your organization uses as its business contact (either your own work email or one for a generic inbox) and a unique password. Your password must be at least 8 characters long and contain one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter and one number. Enter your password again to confirm it.

#### **Step Three: Public-Sector Buyer Information**

Fill out all required fields (indicated by a bold label and an asterisk “\*”).

- "Public Sector Entity” is the area of federal, provincial or municipal government, or any other type of public entity, for which you work. For example, if you are part of a ministry, this would be your ministry’s name.
- You may optionally provide branch name, too.

#### **Step Four: Contact Information (Optional)**

All of the fields in this section are optional and are recommended if you would like to provide additional contact information to the Program. Vendors and other public-sector buyers will not be able to view this information.

#### **Step Five: Industry Sector(s)**

Select the “Industry Sectors” that relate to your work by clicking the “Add” button and selecting from the provided dropdown list. At least one “Industry Sector” must be selected to create your account.

Providing an “Industry Sector” enables the Program to connect you with vendors that are active in the same “Industry Sector”.

#### **Step Six: Area(s) of Interest**

Add an “Area of Interest” to identify a good or service that you may need to solve your business problem or issue. Select your “Area(s) of Interest” by clicking the “Add” button and selecting from the provided dropdown list. At “least one Area” of Interest must be selected to create your account, but many can be selected if a broad range of goods or services apply.

The available “Areas of Interest” are based on the “Commodity Codes” used by BC Bid [(www.bcbid.gov.bc.ca)](https://www.bcbid.gov.bc.ca/open.dll/welcome?language=En). “Commodity Codes” are a standard classification of goods and services used by the Province.

Selecting an “Area of Interest” enables the Program to connect you with vendors that offer goods or services that are classified under the same “Commodity Code”.

#### **Step Seven: Create Account (Registered User Profile)**

Once all required fields on the form have been completed, click the “Create Account” button to create your account within the Concierge Web App.

#### **Step Eight: Agree to Terms & Conditions**

During the registration process, you will be presented with the Terms and Conditions of the Concierge Web App. To agree to the Terms and Conditions, scroll to the end of the Terms and Conditions and click the “I Agree” button on the bottom-right corner of the screen.

If you wish to agree to the Terms and Conditions later, you may do so by clicking the “Skip” link.

Once you have agreed to accept the Terms and Conditions, your registration will be complete, and you will receive full access to the benefits and features of the Concierge Web App.

### **(ii) Requests for Information (RFIs)**

You may use an RFI to conduct market sounding research to better understand what is available in the marketplace. RFIs do not create a competitive process or involve ranking or scoring of any responses received.

#### **How to View RFIs**

A complete listing of RFIs posted through the Concierge Web App can be viewed [here](https://procurementconcierge.gov.bc.ca/requests-for-information) (or by clicking the “RFIs” link at the top of the page). The details of an RFI can be viewed by clicking on its “Project Title”.

#### **Want to Post an RFI?**

RFIs are used as a market sounding tool to gather information from the real experts – the vendors – about what is available in the marketplace. Vendors with accounts on the Concierge Web App will be able to view and respond to your RFIs.

If you are interested in posting an RFI, please email your request to <Procurement.Concierge@gov.bc.ca>. Program Staff will work with you to develop and manage your RFI.

### **(iii) Discovery Day Sessions**

#### **Want to Participate in a Discovery Day Session?**

You may include a Discovery Day Session as part of your RFI. A Discovery Day Session is a meeting specific to one or more RFIs that vendors can attend to discuss your needs and ask questions. Discovery Day Sessions are an opportunity for you to meet with vendors who may have solutions to your business problems and to provide more information about your needs, requirements and constraints. The intent is to improve the vendors’ understanding of what you need, which will assist them in responding to the RFI in a manner that best elicits the market information you are seeking in order to assist you with your procurement planning objectives.

If you are interested in participating in a Discovery Day Session, please email your request to <Procurement.Concierge@gov.bc.ca>. Program Staff will assist you with developing and managing your RFI and your participation in a Discovery Day Session.

### **(iv) Unsolicited Proposals (UPs)**

Please note that this part of the Program is restricted to core ministry buyers at this time. Broader Public Sector buyers will be notified if the UP Program becomes available to them.

#### **How to View Eligible UPs**

A complete listing of eligible UPs posted through the Concierge Web App can be viewed by clicking the “Unsolicited Proposals” tab at the top of the page. By default, all UPs are listed, however you can filter by Commodity Code or Industry Sector. The details of a UP can be viewed by clicking on its “Learn More” button.

More information about a UP can be displayed by clicking “View Attachments”. At a minimum, Vendors are required to submit a “Detailed Information” document, however some Vendors may choose to provide more documents.

If you are interested in learning more about an Unsolicited Proposal, click “Express Interest” and email your request to <Procurement.Concierge@gov.bc.ca>. The Program Staff will work with you through every step, from requesting secondary level information from the vendor, facilitating a face-to-face Clarification Meeting, to moving to a procurement, if the purchase of goods or services is desired.

#### **How to submit an Unsolicited Proposal**

##### **Step 1: Create an Account**

Create an account and agree to the terms and conditions.

##### **Step 2: Download the Detailed Information Application Form**

Download the “Detailed Information” application form found on the “My Unsolicited Proposals” tab.

##### **Step 3. Complete the Detailed Information Application Form**

There is no ability to save the data entered into this form. Therefore, it is recommended that you save the document, complete the form offline, then upload it to the Web App as an attachment to the UP Application form.

If your UP, once assessed, is eligible for the Program, the information included in this form will be visible to Potential Buyers.

UPs are intended to be anonymous to Potential Buyers. Therefore, please do not include your name, your organization’s name or any trademarks, propriety or confidential information in your Unsolicited Proposal as such information may be disclosed under the Province’s policy or pursuant to freedom of information laws. If you do include such information, Program Staff may request that you revise your Unsolicited Proposal to remove such information prior to assessing your UP.

**_The following will provide some guidance on what information to include in the Detailed Information Form_**

##### **1. Detailed Description of the UP**

##### **_a. Full Description of the UP_**

In this section describe the good or service you are proposing. Avoid using jargon or technical terms when describing your unique or innovative idea. Do not include any trademarks or propriety or confidential information.

##### **_b. Objectives, Outcomes, and Benefits of the UP_**

In this section describe the objectives, outcomes, and anticipated benefits of the good or service you are proposing. Be sure to provide enough information for Program Staff to assess your UP against the eligibility criteria.

##### **_c. High-level Timelines_**

In this section provide a high-level timeline around the expected implementation or delivery of the goods or services you are proposing.

##### **_d. Additional Relevant Information_**

In this section, please provide any additional information that you think Program Staff would want to know about the good or service in order to assess the UP against the eligibility criteria. Remember that the information submitted on this form is intended to be high-level.

##### **2. High-Level pricing, methodology, and approach**

This information is not intended to be a bid price or firm pricing. Any pricing information provided in a UP will be used to assist Buyers in its procurement planning.

##### **3. Potential Beneficiaries**

Identify which Ministries may benefit from the good or services proposed, if known. If your UP is eligible, this information may be used by Program Staff to connect you with Potential Buyers in accordance with Stage 3 of the process as described in UP Policy and Process Overview.

##### **4. Track record**

What is the track record of this concept in BC, Canada, and in other global jurisdictions? Has this good or service been used before in another context? If so, please provide information on where it was used and in what capacity. Describe the benefits that were realized by those using this good or service.

##### **Step 4. Create Your Unsolicited Proposal Online**

Once the Detailed Information application form has been completed, you may submit your UP to Program Staff for review by clicking the "Create Unsolicited Proposal" button and filling out the UP application.

**_The following will provide some guidance on what information to include in your Unsolicited Proposal (UP) Application_**

##### **_Section 1: Attachment(s)_**

A completed "Unsolicited Proposal - Detailed Information" document is a mandatory component of the UP and must be attached to the UP application or you will be unable to submit.

Any additional attached documents should support your UP in meeting the Eligibility Criteria. Do not include generic marketing material or documents that could identify your organization (for example, do not include your name or the name or branding of your organization). Please note that each file size is restricted to 10MB.

##### **_Section 2: Description_**

The **“title”** field is intended to be a headline, so must fit into the space on the Concierge Web App where eligible UPs will be displayed. Do not include company identifying information such as company name, logos, trademarks, etc.

The **“Brief Description”** field is intended to be a short “elevator pitch” to give Potential Buyers a sense of in the goods or services being proposed in the UP.

The **“industry sector”** and **“area of interest”** fields will be used by Program Staff to help identify Potential Buyers who may be interested in your UP. Additionally, Potential Buyers will be able to filter eligible UPs in the Web App by these fields.

While Vendors can select all “industry sectors” and “areas of interest”, selecting all “industry sectors” and “areas of interest” when not all apply may undermine the relevance of the UP in the applicable “industry sectors” and “areas of interest”. It is therefore recommended that only the “industry sectors” and “areas of interest” that Vendors believe are relevant to the goods and services proposed should be selected. The screenshot below shows how eligible UPs are displayed to Registered Buyers in the web app.

![Unsolicited Proposals Screenshot](/unsolicited_proposal_list_screenshot.png)

##### **_Section 3: Eligibility_**

The information provided in this section will be used by Program Staff to assess if the UP meets the Eligibility Criteria.

##### **Benefit to Province**

Provide high-level information about how your UP would generate benefits for a Potential Buyer. This is not business case level detail; if your idea is screened in, you can provide that analysis later.

##### **Innovation Type**

Use the selection boxes to indicate how your UP is unique and innovative. The information provided in this section will be used by Program Staff to assess if the goods or services in the UP are considered innovative.

##### **_Section 4: Contact Information_**

The contact person named in this section will be the primary point of contact for all Program activities related to this particular UP.

##### **Step 5. Submit Your Unsolicited Proposal**

Once all mandatory fields are completed, ensure the “Detailed Information” form and any other relevant documents are attached. Submit your UP by selecting the “Submit Application” button. A confirmation email that your UP has been received will be sent to the email address provided in this section.

Note that the “Submit Application” button will not activate until the Detailed Information form is attached and all required fields are completed.

##### **Step 6. Monitor Your Unsolicited Proposal**

Program Staff will review your UP to see if it meets eligibility criteria and update the status of your application as required. Status may appear as:

**Application Submitted** – the UP has been received is in the queue to be assessed by Program Staff  
**Under Review** – the UP is being assessed by Program Staff  
**Edits Required** – Program Staff have identified changes that the Vendor must make before the UP can proceed (e.g. remove identifying information)  
**Edits Submitted** – the edits made by the Vendor have been submitted, to be reviewed by Program Staff  
**Eligible** – UP has met eligibility considerations and is now visible to Potential Buyers  
**Ineligible** – UP has not met eligibility considerations, not visible to Potential Buyers  
**Under Procurement** – UP has been accepted by a Potential Buyer and procurement is underway. No longer visible to Potential Buyers.  
**Closed** – the UP is closed and not being considered
